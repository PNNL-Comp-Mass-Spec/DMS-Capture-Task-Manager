Capture Task Manager History

Version 1.1.4475; April 2, 2012
	- Updated the DatasetQuality plugin to dynamically load clsMSFileInfoScanner from within MSFileInfoScannerInterfaces.dll, which is stored at C:\DMS_Programs\MSFileInfoScanner
		- Allowed us to remove all of the Proteowizard-related DLLs from the Capture Task Manager program folder

Version 1.0.4472; March 30, 2012
	- Now occasionally removing old temp files in the system temp folder

Version 1.0.4470; March 28, 2012
	- Updated the MyEMSL component of the DatasetArchivePlugin to only process the files in subfolders when running an archive update job
	- Now calling procedure StoreMyEMSLUploadStats to store MyEMSL upload stats in the DMS_Capture DB

Version 1.1.4466; March 24, 2012
	- Updated DatasetArchivePlugin to optionally push data into MyEMSL
	- New version of MSFileInfoScanner.dll that uses ProteoWizard to process QTrap datasets
	- Switched from StringDictionary to Generic.Dictionary<string, string> in ITaskParams
	- Added StringDictionary to Generic.Dictionary<string, string> to IMgrParams

Version 1.1.4458; March 16, 2012
	- New version of MD5StageFileCreator.dll that auto-renames the stagemd5 file if a file copy conflict occurs and the suffix ends in __ExtraFiles001

Version 1.1.4457; March 15, 2012
	- No longer creating the Tool_Version_Info_ImsDeMultiplex.txt file during demultiplexing

Version 1.1.4456; March 14, 2012
	- Now storing the tool version in the database using SetStepTaskToolVersion
	- Updated ImsDemuxPlugin to allow use of either BelovTransform.dll or IMSDemultiplexer.dll
		- Currently hard-coded to always use BelovTransform.dll

Version 1.1.4454; March 12, 2012
	- Updated ImsDemuxPlugin to use C# based demultiplexer (IMSDemultiplexer.dll)

Version 1.1.4450; March 8, 2012
	- Updated to use UIMF Library v2.0.4450
	- New version of MSFileInfoScanner.dll that uses UIMFLibrary v2.0 and Ionic.zip
	- Updated DatasetQualityPlugin to report MSFileInfoScanner errors in retData.CloseoutMsg

Version 1.1.4421; February 8, 2012
	- Capture Plugin now sets EvalCode to 3 (EVAL_CODE_NETWORK_ERROR_RETRY_CAPTURE) if a network error occurs during capture
		- Stored Procedure SetStepTaskComplete recognizes this code and will auto-retry capture
	- Fixed bug in Capture Plugin that was wiring up multiple event handlers to the clsFileTools events
	- Fixed bug in Capture Plugin that was recursively capturing files and folders for Bruker Imaging datasets

Version 1.1.4416; February 3, 2012
	- Updated CaptureToolPlugin to use CopyDirectoryWithResume when copying 15T_FTICR datasets
	- Updated CaptureToolPlugin to store error messages in retData.CloseoutMsg (message is stored in Completion_Message in the DB)
	- New version of Prism.dll

Version 1.1.4413; January 31, 2012
	- Updated DatasetQualityPlugin to recognize Bruker_Amazon_Ion_Trap datasets (which have an analysis.yep file in a .D folder)
	- New version of MSFileInfoScanner.dll

Version 1.1.4412; January 30, 2012
	- Updated CaptureToolPlugin to support connecting to Bionet shares either using Prism.DLL or using clsNetworkConnection
		- Advantage of clsNetworkConnection is better handling of exceptions
		- Disadvantage is that you cannot connect to a share more than once as the same user, which the application sometimes thinks is the case if capturing numerous files from the same share
		- This support was required for capturing data from \\15T_FTICR.bionet\ProteomicsData since network errors were regularly happening, including having problems copying huge files (over 4 GB) 
	- Added support for parsing command line switches when starting CaptureTaskManager.exe
		- Use /T to enter CodeTest mode	
	- Updated DatasetIntegrityPlugin to auto-delete superseded .D folders (x_ folders) if they are empty or if every file present is also present in the newly captured folder

Version 1.1.4408; January 26, 2012
	- Updated DatasetArchivePlugin to merge existing __ExtraFiles staging files with a newly created __ExtraFiles staging file

Version 1.1.4405; January 23, 2012
	- Updated DatasetArchivePlugin to create an MD5 staging file when initially archiving a dataset
		- Moved CreateMD5StagingFile into clsOpsBase

Version 1.1.4402; January 20, 2012
	- Changed several log messages from INFO level to DEBUG level
		- Also changed several messages to only log in the local file and not in the DMS_Capture database
	- Updated the Dataset Archive plugin to create MD5 staging files using MD5StageFileCreator.dll

Version 1.1.4373; December 22, 2011
	- Now validating that the server on which the dataset resides has sufficient free space when performing operations that will write new data to the server
		- Affects all step tools except ArchiveUpdate, DatasetArchive, and SourceFileRename

Version 1.1.4370; December 19, 2011
	- Updated manager settings (m_ParamDictionary) to use a generic string dictionary
	- Tweaked log messages for DatasetIntegrity plugin
	- New version of the MSFileInfoScanner
	- Updated DatasetQuality plugin to send the path to the analysis.baf file to the MSFileInfoScanner for Bruker_FT datasets

Version 1.1.4304; October 14, 2011
	- Updated DatasetArchive to compute a SHA hash if the file in the archive was modified within the last 35 days

Version 1.1.4303; October 13, 2011
	- Updated DatasetArchive plugin to simply compare file sizes and file dates when determining whether a file in the archive needs to be updated
		- Previously computed a SHA hash on each file
		- Unfortunately, due to a large number of our files being purged from spinning disk and only residing on tape, retrieval via the tape robot is prohibitively slow

Version 1.1.4294; October 4, 2011
	- No longer logging "Step complete" messages to the database
	- No longer logging "Failure running tool" messages to the database

	- Now checking for errors 53 and 1326 when connecting to a bionet folder

Version 1.1.4230; August 1, 2011
	 - Changed minimum WIFF scan file size to 30 bytes

Version 1.1.4225; July 27, 2011
	 - Decrease minimum size of a .Wiff file to 50 KB

Version 1.1.4224; July 26, 2011

Version 1.1.4220; July 22, 2011
	- Now ignoring LCMethod*.xml files when checking whether safe to re-try the capture of a dataset

Version 1.1.4213; July 15, 2011
	- Now copying LCMethod files from \\proto-5\BionetXfer\Run_Complete_Trigger\MethodFiles to the dataset folder during Capture
		- LCMethod folders are renamed to x_ if the file copy is successful
		- LCMethod folders that start with x_ and are more than 14 days old are deleted (checking is limited to 6p to 8p daily)
	- New UIMF Library

Version 1.1.4203; July 5, 2011
	- No longer disabling manager after excessive errors requesting a task

	- Added try/catch blocks to clsDemuxTools
	- New version of UIMFLibrary.dll

Version 1.1.4192; June 24, 2011
	- Updated ImsDemuxPlugin to look for the presence of calibration frames or calibration tables.  
		- If neither exists, then calibration is not performed.  
		- This is logged as a warning but is not a fatal error

Version 1.1.4186; June 18, 2011
	- Now calibrating .UIMF files after demultiplexing.  
		- If demultiplexing succeeds but calibration fails, the demultiplexed .UIMF file will be copied to the storage server, but the step tool will report processing failed.

Version 1.1.4184; June 16, 2011
	- Now copying the CalibrationLog.txt file to the storage server at the completion of demultiplexing and calibration
	- Now skipping calibration when the instrument is IMS_TOF_1, IMS_TOF_2, or IMS_TOF_3

Version 1.1.4183; June 15, 2011
	- Now calling GetCalibrationFinishDate() to confirm that calibration was performed
		- We are also calling GetDemultiplexingFinishDate()
	- Now reporting "De-multiplexed and calibrated" on success
